      A Tale of Two Cities is a historical novel published in 1859 by Charles
      Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution.
      The novel tells the story of the French Doctor Manette, his 18-year-long
      imprisonment in the Bastille in Paris, and his release to live in London
      with his daughter Lucie whom he had never met. The story is set against
      the conditions that led up to the French Revolution and the Reign of
      Terror. As Dickens's best-known work of historical fiction, A Tale of Two
      Cities is said to be one of the best-selling novels of all time.[2][3][4]
      In 2003, the novel was ranked 63rd on the BBC's The Big Read poll.[5] The
      novel has been adapted for film, television, radio, and the stage, and has
      continued to influence popular culture.

      In 1775, Jerry Cruncher flags down the nightly mail-coach en route from
      London to Dover. Cruncher is an employee of Tellson's Bank in London; he
      carries a message for Jarvis Lorry, one of the bank's managers. Lorry
      sends Jerry back with the cryptic response "Recalled to Life", referring
      to Alexandre Manette, a French physician who has been released from the
      Bastille after an 18-year imprisonment. On arrival in Dover, Lorry meets
      Dr Manette's daughter Lucie and her governess, Miss Pross. Believing her
      father to be dead, Lucie faints at the news that he is alive. Lorry takes
      her to France for a reunion. In the Paris neighbourhood of the Faubourg
      Saint-Antoine, Dr Manette has been given lodgings by his former servant
      Ernest Defarge and his wife Therese, the owners of a wine shop. Lorry and
      Lucie find him in a small garret where he spends much of his time
      distractedly and obsessively making shoes â€“ a skill he learned in prison.
      Lorry and Lucie take him back to England.
